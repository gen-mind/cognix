This will be the UI of CogniX-Bot

We will expose OpenAI compatible APIs 
In the UI the customer can see the chat history by session
can configure LLM and all the toher feature of cognix
There will not be any Chat UI

We then need to see how many chat plug ins aready exists
Eventually contacting them, if needed, to see if they want to support CogniX by design

might also be a different github project
