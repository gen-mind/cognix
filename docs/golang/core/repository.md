### Repository package 

This package provides several struct definitions aimed at facilitating interactions with the database. Each struct incorporates methods that support various data manipulation operations such as creation, updating and deletion. Additionally, these methods also support reading data based upon provided parameters.
What this effectively means is, each struct encapsulates a set of operations that can be executed against the database. The methods tied to these structs abstract the raw SQL and offer a more user-friendly and type-safe way to perform required operations on the data stored in the database.
Currently, this package provides an implementation of a client for CockroachDB, a cloud-native, distributed SQL database that provides next-level consistency, scalability, and resilience. It utilizes go-pg/pg, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) in Go, for managing the database operations. The ORM allows for better structuring of code by mapping the database responses to golang objects, which reduces a lot of unnecessary work and typo errors. This helps to make the database-related code more efficient, reusable and easier to maintain.
Should you need to interact with different database technologies in the future, you can build upon the existing structure and methods to handle those needs seamlessly. This ensures that your codebase remains adaptable and extensible, capable of meeting changing requirements or scaling needs.
