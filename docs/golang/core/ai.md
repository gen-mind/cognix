## AI package 

This package is dedicated to facilitating smooth communication with various Artificial Intelligence (AI) services, including but not limited to systems like Embedder and OpenAI GPT-3. Each AI client in the package is systematically designed to manage and orchestrate interactions between the primary service and the respective AI service being used.
The AI clients function as intermediaries, simplifying the process of sending requests to and receiving responses from these AI services. These interaction points involve a variety of operations, from sending data for processing and analysis, to receiving complex AI-driven insights, all carried out with an emphasis on efficiency, reliability, and security.
One of the key strengths of this package is its adaptability. As the landscape of AI services evolves, new AI platforms can emerge offering novel capabilities. This package is designed with this in mind, allowing for future expansion. On-demand new AI clients can be added to it over time, enabling our system's seamless integration with emerging AI technologies and keeping it at the forefront of innovation. By laying this groundwork, we ensure a resilient infrastructure capable of adapting dynamically to changing AI needs.
