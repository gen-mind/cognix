## Cognix use case: the aviation engineer

Let's take the example of an **Avionics Engineer** specialized in Fly-by-Wire (FBW) systems. 

The engineer receives a notification about a malfunction in the Fly-by-Wire system of an Airbus A320. The message indicates issues with the aircraft's electronic flight control system, which has led to instability in pitch and roll commands.

2. **Preparing for the Task**: 
   - **Retrieve Documentation**: The engineer uses CogniX to quickly search for relevant sections in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) and the specific service bulletins related to FBW systems.
   - **Access Personal Notes**: CogniX retrieves the engineer’s previous troubleshooting notes on similar issues, highlighting successful resolutions and common pitfalls.
   - **Simulate the Issue**: The engineer can also use CogniX to run simulations based on the error codes received from the aircraft’s Built-In Test Equipment (BITE), identifying potential root causes before heading to the aircraft.

4. **Verification and Reporting**: 
   - **System Verification**: Post-repair, the engineer runs verification tests to ensure the FBW system is functioning correctly. CogniX logs the results and compares them with baseline data.
   - **Reporting**: Finally, the engineer uses CogniX to generate a detailed report of the issue, the steps taken to resolve it, and any follow-up actions required. This report is automatically synced with the maintenance database for future reference.
