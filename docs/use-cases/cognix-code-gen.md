Hey there! We're Gian and Michael,  Weâ€™re excited to have you here!


CogniX is an AI code generator that creates entire features or extensive code blocks by analyzing your existing codebase. It mimics your project's style, rules, and patterns, ensuring new code aligns seamlessly with your standardsâ€”automatically generating front-end, back-end, database, and more based on your prompts.
<br />



## `Features`

An advanced AI code generator that can integrate seamlessly with your development environment, offering capabilities such as:

- **Connects to your repo, GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Azure DevOps**
- **Generates entire features, APIs, and complex code structures**
- **Adheres to your project's style, rules, and patterns**
- **Instructable via easy-to-setup connectors:**
  - - **Analyzes all the code in your repo**
  - - **Learns from your Google Drive**
  - - **Understands files from your OneDrive**

Capable of:
- **Automating feature development**
- **Creating database schemas**
- **Building front-end and back-end code**
- **Integrating with CI/CD pipelines**
- **Following project-specific development guidelines**

For detailed documentation and setup guides, visit [CogniX Docs](https://docs.cognix.ch/).

## `What We Need to Do Next`

- Finalize the UI, and fix all UI-related bugs
- Create a generic plugin that connects to the CogniX AI code generator
- Develop a plugin for VS Code
- Complete all UI, back-end, and DevOps tasks
- Address all remaining bugs

## `Documentation`

- User documentation at [rag.cognix.ch](https://rag.cognix.ch)
- Technical documentation in this repo at [GitHub](https://github.com/gen-mind/cognix/tree/develop/docs)

## `Funding`

In our [pitch deck video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grWGugrkxew), we mentioned that we are seeking $1 million in funding for a 9% equity stake in the company. This investment will be crucial, with roughly 80% allocated for project development and 20% for marketing and sales. We are looking for venture capital and also considering crowdfunding. If you're interested, you can support us by purchasing a portion of this 9% stake.

## `Future Vision`

Gian and Michael, the co-founders, are conducting interviews with CXOs and decision-makers to identify market needs and refine our offerings. As we progress, CogniX will evolve to address more complex use cases and expand its impact across various industries.
