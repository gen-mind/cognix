## `Funding`
In our [pitch deck video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grWGugrkxew), we mentioned that we are seeking $1 million in funding for a 9% equity stake in the company. This investment will be crucial, with roughly 80% allocated for project development and 20% for marketing and sales. We are looking for venture capital and also considering crowdfunding. If you're interested, you can support us by purchasing a portion of this 9% stake.
