### `Converting knowledge to textual format`
A crucial aspect of any RAG is to convert any sort of knowledge in textual format so that it can be fed into a vector database. With this in mind, we are working on:
- Connecting various data sources
- Extracting textual information from an increasing number of file types

We have already developed connectors for:
- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- Microsoft Teams chat and Teams, including files
- Websites
- YouTube videos

We can extract textual data from video, audio, images, and the most common file extensions:
- Documents: PDF, XPS, TXT, DOCX, DOC, XLSX, XLS, PPTX, PPT, HWPX, EPUB, MOBI, FB2, CBZ, MD
- URLs: URL, YT
- Audio/Video: MP4, MP3, MPEG, MPGA, M4A, WAV, WEBM, MOV
- Images: JPEG, JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, TIF, WEBP, PPM, PGM, PBM
